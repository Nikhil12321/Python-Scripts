# Scripts I use to automate stuff 

**1. read_site_tags.py** : python script that reads website's source and ouputted into a format perfect for inserting data into my sql database

**2. name_change.py** : read all files in a directory and append their name with something

**3. git.sh** : automatic push to github. Have to input the username password manually.

**4. try.sh** : REALLY COOL. Pushes to github. You don't even have to enter your username password. Just pass the commit name as command line arguement. Uses expect script
